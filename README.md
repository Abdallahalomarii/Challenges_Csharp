- ### Approach & Efficiency

    - What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach

        - i make an nested iterations approaach to loop thorugh  my array, first i created a variable to hold my first element in the array
        then i created anothe integer variabel to hold my max frequent counter then i iterate through my array, then i create another 
        variabel to hold every iterate counter and called freqeuent and then i create anothe loop to iterate though 
        my array to compare two elements and if it is equal then frquent ++ 
        then after the array finish i make a condation if the frequent more than the max frquent 
        then assign the frequnt inside the maxfrequent and assign the array element inside the frquent number and after the loop finish return the frequent number

        - the Big O notation is O(n^2) for the Time complexity and the space  O(1) .

- ### Solution

    - To run my code just copy the repo inside your vs and then open it and run directly it should give you this screen 

    - here are some screen shots for my code :
